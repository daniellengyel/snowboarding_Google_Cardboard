Snowboarding in Virtual Reality 

The game was intended to be backcountry snowboarding skiing game which let's you explore the nice scenery in low-poly style (ala the Google cardboard app).

Overall small VR snowboarding project which implements all the controls needed to properly move a snowboarder. 
A learning experience in calculating all the forces properly and make the player behave realistically.

Quick Guide
==================================
The relevant scripts are in Project/Assets/Scripts. The main script, where all the calculations happen, is PlayerControls.

The project is ready as is. You just have to import the Project folder and run it on your local unity instance. The controls are straightforward. To turn use the control key (mac) and move the mouse and to look around use the option key (mac) and the mouse. 

The skiing slope is costum made, so it may be useful to download that in adition to the script. The rest, can be setup seperatly since the proejct is quiet large. 

The project works with google Cardboard. There should be build included which runs. Otherwise, you can create it from the project itself.

Improvements:
================================
• The terrain is still pretty boring and there is no real objective. If anyone has ideas, let me know :D. This was intended to be backcountry snowboarding skiing game so it would be nice to give it that feel.

• Add jumps and tricks to the possible movements. This may be difficult with the limited range of inputs of the google cardboard, but I believe that there is a nice minimalistic approach to it. All those buttons from other snowboarding games are just distracting.

• Improve the feel of the game. For this I would have to use Maya or other similar software, which I am not trainded in.
